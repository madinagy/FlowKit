**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
I am trying to load my newly compensated data back into FlowJo after it has already been biexponentially transformed. However, there is no feature on FlowJo to have NO transform therefore the values look incredibly screwed

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I would like an inverse biex functions so that I could convert the data back before I put it into FlowJo. 

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Trying to remove transformation from FlowJo (trying to work with them on doing this), or apply no transformation at first except it doesn't let me proceed without a transformation. 

**Additional context**
Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.
